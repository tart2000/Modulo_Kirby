    Modulo has changed my life as an animator and trainer!
    No more tinkering with spreadsheets to create animation scenarios! Modulo's functionalities add up and are always more practical and fun. The first one (the basic one) = no need to recalculate the timings each time a sequence is modified or added... It's magic!

    You only have to use it once to ask yourself "How could I live without it!
    Extremely useful as a time manager for presentations, meetings, workshops that need precise timing... but also the ability to adapt to unexpected events.

    Facilitator, I found in modulo "THE" tool I needed to write my lesson plans. To build sequence by sequence, to set the time, to note the instructions and the material, to be able to see the tasks and the who does what.... with color codes, the formats of the sequences... In short, this is a tool that is made to order, and that continues to improve over time. All this for free, with a paying option for a team in order to share our workflows. To be tested right away if it is not already done :)
